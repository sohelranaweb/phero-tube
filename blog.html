            1. Discuss the scope of var, let, and const?
          </h1>
          <p>
            In JavaScript, var, let, and const are used to declare variables,
            but they have different scopes and behaviors. Understanding the
            scope of these keywords is crucial for writing clean and bug-free
            code. Here's a detailed discussion of the scope of var, let, and
            const:
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg font-medium">Var:</p>
          <p>
            <span class="text-lg font-medium">Function Scope:</span> Variables
            declared with var are function-scoped. This means they are
            accessible anywhere within the function in which they are declared.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg font-medium">Let:</p>
          <p>
            <span class="text-lg font-medium">Block Scope:</span> Variables
            declared with let are block-scoped, meaning they are accessible only
            within the block (enclosed by curly braces) in which they are
            declared. This includes loops, conditionals, and functions.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg font-medium">Const:</p>
          <p>
            <span class="text-lg font-medium">Block Scope:</span> Like let,
            variables declared with const are block-scoped and accessible only
            within the block in which they are defined. Constant Value: const
            variables, once assigned a value, cannot be reassigned. They are
            read-only, but for objects and arrays, the properties or elements
            they contain can still be modified.

            2. Tell us the use cases of null and undefined?
          </h1>
          <p>
            null and undefined are two distinct values in JavaScript, and they
            are used in different scenarios to represent different concepts.
            Understanding when and how to use them is important for writing
            robust and clear code.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg font-medium">2.1 Undefined:</p>
          <p>
            <span class="text-lg font-medium">Default Value:</span> Variables
            that have been declared but have not been assigned a value
            automatically have the value undefined. This is useful when you want
            to declare a variable without initializing it immediately.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span class="text-lg font-medium">Function Parameters:</span>
            Variables If a function is called with fewer arguments than it
            expects, the missing parameters are automatically set to undefined.
            This can be useful when a function has optional parameters.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span class="text-lg font-medium">Property Access:</span> Like let,
            When you try to access an object property that doesn't exist, it
            returns undefined.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="text-lg font-medium">2.2 Null</p>
          <p>
            <span class="text-lg font-medium">Explicit Absence of Value:</span>
            Unlike undefined, null is used when you want to explicitly indicate
            that a variable or object property intentionally has no value or is
            empty.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="text-lg font-medium">Resetting Values:</span> You can
            set a variable to null to indicate that it should no longer
            reference any value, and this can be useful for releasing memory or
            resetting a value.

            3. What do you mean by REST API?
          </h1>
          <p>
            REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application
            Programming Interface. It is an architectural style and a set of
            constraints for designing networked applications. REST is not a
            protocol but rather a set of principles and constraints that guide
            how web services should be designed. It was introduced by Roy
            Fielding in his doctoral dissertation in 2000 and has since become a
            widely adopted approach for building web APIs.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            <span class="text-lg font-medium">Stateless:</span> Each request
            from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to
            understand and process the request. The server should not rely on
            any prior requests or stored client state. This makes REST APIs
            scalable and easy to manage.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span class="text-lg font-medium">Client-Server Architecture:</span>
            REST separates the client and server components of an application,
            allowing them to evolve independently. This separation enhances
            scalability and simplifies development.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span class="text-lg font-medium">Uniform Interface:</span> REST
            APIs have a consistent and uniform interface, which typically
            includes using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for
            different operations on resources. This consistency makes it easy
            for developers to understand and use the API.
